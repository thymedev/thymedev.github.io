## Downtime Alert

We are aware the Better Discord Bots are currently down.

The team is away for Christmas and New Years. We apologize for the inconvenience.

If you are able to selfhost a Discord bot, please refer to [Thyme Coffee: Getting Started](https://thymedev.github.io/coffee/start/), then install the `roleinvite` cog (not affiliated with Thyme Dev):

```
[p]repo add laggrons-dumb-cogs https://github.com/retke/Laggrons-Dumb-Cogs
[p]cog install laggrons-dumb-cogs roleinvite
```
