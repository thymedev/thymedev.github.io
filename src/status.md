## ðŸŸ¢ âœ… **Downtime Resolved**

All bots are online again after extended recovery.

> **Please check your settings and re-setup as needed.**

The Thyme Dev team's bot and database hosting ran into a fatal error while we were away for the New Year and unable to access our systems.

Over the past few days, we have made significant changes in our backend to improve recoverability and prevent this type of catastrophic data loss in the future.

Thank you for your patience as we continue to improve.
