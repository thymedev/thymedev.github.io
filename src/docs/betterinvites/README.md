**`/help`**:

## Something is not working!
### It says "I can't interact with the following roles:..."
Verify that role hierarchies allow BetterInvites to give those roles. It cannot give roles higher on the hierarchy than itself. [more info](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/214836687-Role-Management-101).

### Roles are not being assigned!
It's possible permissions may not be set up correctly. Try kicking and reinviting the bot with [this](https://thymedev.github.io/invite/betterinvites).

## More Info
### Remove a role invite
Use the `/createinvite [invite]` command again and don't select any roles. The bot will not assign any roles to people who use that invite.
Confirm it has been removed with `/display`.

### Assign multiple roles for each invite
If you would like an invite to give multiple roles when someone joins, select multiple roles when prompted.
