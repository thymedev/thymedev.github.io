Japanese dictionary bot. Searches Jisho using Jisho API. Includes alternate links to Wiktionary, DeepL, and Google Translate.


## About

**CHA-JA is the Japanese Discord bot that delivers language and dictionary information to students, travelers, and anime enthusiasts alike.**

The Japanese language is one of the most intricate and beautiful languages in the world. However, its three scripts - Kanji, Hiragana, and Katakana - make it challenging for beginners. Often, learners face difficulties with romanization (Romaji), understanding word definitions, and accessing comprehensive information about vocabulary.

**CHA-JA** is a unified turnkey solution for searching dictionary sources, displaying Romaji pronunciations, word definitions/origins, and links to relevant external sources.

**CHA-JA** uses data from public sources including [Jisho](https://jisho.org/about).
