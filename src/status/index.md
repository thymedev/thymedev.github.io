## üü¢ ‚úÖ Apr 9, 2023: **Invite Issues Resolved**

We have deployed a new hotfix that should resolve this issue.

We will continue to monitor the situation.

#### üü° ‚è≥ Mar 31, 2023: **Invite Issues**

We are aware of issues with inviting BetterInvites v2. We've reached capacity again.

There is no ETA for resolving this issue.

While we work on expanding BetterInvites v2 to more users, we [recommend using BetterInvites v1 for now instead](https://thymedev.github.io/invite/betterinvites/v1).

If you are able to selfhost, please consider [reading this blog post about selfhosting a BetterInvites alternative](https://coffeebank.github.io/blog/posts/betterinvites).

## üì£ Feb 22, 2023: **New: BetterInvites v2**

We are releasing a new version of BetterInvites bot, fully rewritten to support slash commands!

This bot is currently open in public beta with no waitlists.

Feel free to try it out and let us know your thoughts!
