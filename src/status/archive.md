We have deployed a new hotfix that should resolve this issue.

We will continue to monitor the situation.

#### 🟡 ⏳ Mar 31, 2023: **Invite Issues**

We are aware of issues with inviting BetterInvites v2. We've reached capacity again.

There is no ETA for resolving this issue.

While we work on expanding BetterInvites v2 to more users, we [recommend using BetterInvites v1 for now instead](https://thymedev.github.io/invite/betterinvites/v1).

If you are able to selfhost, please consider [reading this blog post about selfhosting a BetterInvites alternative](https://coffeebank.github.io/blog/posts/betterinvites).

## 🟢 ✅ Jan 13, 2023: **Downtime Resolved**

All bots are online again after extended recovery.

> **Some data loss may have occurred.**  
> **Please check your settings and re-setup as needed.**

The Thyme Dev team's bot and database hosting ran into a fatal error while we were away for the New Year and unable to access our systems.

Over the past few days, we have made significant changes in our backend to improve recoverability and prevent this type of catastrophic data loss in the future.

Thank you for your patience as we continue to improve.
