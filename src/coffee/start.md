# Getting Started

Thyme Coffee bots are self-hosted Discord bots that can take your Discord server to the next level.

To get started, you will need to keep the Discord bot running somewhere
- Run the bot off your PC (PC must be on for bot to work, free)
- Run the bot in a server like Amazon AWS/Google GCP (paid service)

It's very easy, takes about 10-20 minutes:

### Step 1: Download Red DiscordBot

- [Installing Red on Windows](https://docs.discord.red/en/stable/install_windows.html)
- [Installing Red on Linux or Mac](https://docs.discord.red/en/stable/install_linux_mac.html)

### Step 2: Add your bot to your Discord server

- [Getting Started](https://docs.discord.red/en/stable/getting_started.html)

### Step 3: Add coffee-cogs

**Red DiscordBot** supports adding plugins ("cogs") to make the bot do more stuff.

**coffee-cogs** is a collection ("repository") of plugins ("cogs") you can add to your **Red DiscordBot**.

When you're ready, browse the list of Thyme Coffee bots and find one you like!

You will see an **Install** box. Just copy-paste the commands and enter them into a chat with your bot:

> Replace [p] with your prefix  
> Replace %%%% with the name of the cog
```
[p]repo add coffee-cogs https://github.com/coffeebank/coffee-cogs
[p]cog install coffee-cogs %%%%%
```

You're done!
