# Getting Started

Coffee Series is a collection of self-hosted Discord Bots that provide advanced features for your server.

Because these bots are so powerful, they can't be invited into your Discord :(

But you can run them off your computer for a Discord server you own :)

It's very easy, takes about 10-20 minutes:

### Step 1: Download Red DiscordBot

- [Installing Red on Windows](https://docs.discord.red/en/stable/install_windows.html)
- [Installing Red on Linux or Mac](https://docs.discord.red/en/stable/install_linux_mac.html)

### Step 2: Add your bot to your Discord server

- [Getting Started](https://docs.discord.red/en/stable/getting_started.html)

### Step 3: Add coffee-cogs

**Red DiscordBot** supports adding plugins ("cogs") to make the bot do more stuff.

**coffee-cogs** is a repository of cogs I've made, that you can add.

Type these commands in a DM with your bot:
```
[p]repo add coffee-cogs https://github.com/coffeebank/coffee-cogs
[p]cog install coffee-cogs %%%%%
```
> Replace [p] with your prefix  
> Replace %%%% with the name of the cog

You're done!
